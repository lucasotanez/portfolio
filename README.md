# Personal Portfolio Project :v:

A web portfolio to showcase my skills, projects, and experience.
Visit [the site](https://lucasotanez.vercel.app) to learn a bit about me.

## Project Stack

To learn more about what I used to build this app, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - Next.js is my JS framework of choice. It is a superset of React.
- [Vercel Documentation](https://vercel.com) - For hosting all JS projects. Next.js is maintained by Vercel, making deployment very simple.
- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/) - I highly prefer and recommend TailwindCSS over vanilla CSS.
- [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/) - Figma is an extremely useful workspace for designing custom icons and SVG graphics.

## Development

Run `npm install` after cloning to install all dependencies.

To start the development server:
```
npm run dev
```
Next.js should output a link to your localhost. Click the link to view the site.

To make changes, start editing *page.tsx*. Your changes will show up in real time on the localhost on your browser.

To compile:
```
npm run build
```
